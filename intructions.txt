building a standalone app that can read rasterized pdfs, convert them to text,  searching through the text for integers of 6 decimals. stores it in a list. compares this list with a given input, and prints out which integers from input field do or do not exist in the list. 
ui=tkinter
to make the app executable as a exe file, cx_Freeze is used

instructions to use and build

executewsl runs the wsl server, executes pdftotext and converts them to text
run this first to generate the .txt inputs
payment checker.py compares the list in a tkinter app
setup.py makes it a executable



1. python executewsl.py
2. python payment_checker.py
3. python setup.py build  


then uyou have an executable that you ran run on any win 11 machine
